## What it does

Once the user enters a text paragraph/sentence or headline of news/rumor, the model simply shows an accurate output if it is Real(tends to 1) or Fake(tends to 0).

## What's next for Fake News Detector

The plan is to convert the project into a working API and an extension for web browsers, such that when someone selects the text and click on the extension button, it will highlight the text as fake or not. This can also be used by social media companies, in order to classify news as fake or real, in order to reduce the spread of fake news.

## How it was built

It is built on python 3.9.6 and flask 2.0.1 along with tensorflow 2.6.0
